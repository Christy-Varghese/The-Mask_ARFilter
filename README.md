1. The-Mask_ARFilter: <br>
This filter is inspired by The Mask (1994) movie and I have given it a anime feel for a change.

2. Whatbro_ARFilter: <br>
In this filter a zombie is responding as "What bro" (real world object)<br>

3. Group helmet: <br>
This is a Group filter where when the user shows a surprised facethe helmet is visible and if smiled it disappears. You can tap screen for revealing the face.
